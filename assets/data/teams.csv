allopi;1;;alloPI;Daniel David, Christian Fleiner, Arjun Rai Gupta, Marvin Okoh, Brian Sailer;;Home automation reduces the resident’s workload of domestic work and improves life quality. However, the installation,  the maintenance and even the application of Smart Home devices are complex operations that require technical knowledge. However, especially people without technical knowledge or with physical impairments would benefit the most by automating their environment. Therefore, we integrate an adaptive and intuitive human-machine interface system into the Smart Home that exceeds the capabilities of common mobile apps. The system adapts to preferences and existing handicaps of the user by using user profiles. We provide counseling, installation and remote maintenance for Smart Homes. No maintenance, no limits – just act your way!;allopi.png;;;;;

zircle;1;;Zircle;Jayesh, Arthur, Enxhi, Andy, Frederik, Mario, Sven;Oct 2018;We know that we cannot continue with the wasteful use of resources, we have to apply a new behaviour in our lifestyle - it's called sharing. The sharing economy leader is BlaBlaCar as Uber and Airbnb are no players in the sharing economy. There are some platforms trying to enable sharing goods between people - but most of them are not good at all. As timing is the main factor whether a idea is going to fail or succeed, we think the time has come to make sharing great again! Focusing on students in the beginning and moving on to other target groups, our slightly different approach how sharing could be done in the future will make it more attractive to people to share. An intuitive progressive web application will be the entry point to a market where we see lots of potential to make a meaningful impact in sharing resources. Together. We share.;zircle.png;;;;;
